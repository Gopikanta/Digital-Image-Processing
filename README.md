Image interpolationNearest - neighbour  interpolation.

DIP_LAB_ 2

1. Read an image and convert it into gray scale image without using builtin function for the function
2. Read an image and display the RGB channel images separately
3. Read an image and convert it into binary image using threshold.
4. Display the histogram of the gray scale image.
5. Apply histogram equalization on an image and display the resultant image.
6. Display the edge map of an image with any edge detection algorithm
7. Download any OCR dataset and perform the classification with SVM and KNN.
8. Implement any two segmentation algorithms and compare the efficiency with ground truth.
9. 9 . Input an image and perform the following morphological operations
    a) Dilation
    b) Erosion
    c) Opening 
    d) Closing
    Display the results
10. Implement any image restoration algorithm
